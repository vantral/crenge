<p>In Mapuche, which aligns with the verb-framed typology as described by Talmy, spatial meanings are predominantly expressed through verb stems and various verbal derivations. This linguistic characteristic signifies that the structure of spatial expressions relies heavily on the verbs themselves, rather than on additional elements like prepositions or adpositions.</p>
<p>The Mapuche spatial system is characterized by a remarkable feature: the presence of only one case marker that encompasses various adjunct relations, including different spatial relations. This marker is versatile, extending beyond spatial contexts to cover a range of non-spatial and argument-like uses.</p>
<p>For instance, it can denote instrumentality, as in "I threatened him with a knife," where the case marker indicates the instrument used. Similarly, it can signify a place, as seen in "They danced there for a long time," where it marks the location of the action.</p>
<p>Moreover, the marker is employed to indicate sources and goals, as in "We made a cable from one town to another," where it highlights both the starting point and the destination. It can also express temporal relationships, such as duration or time of action, as in "I have been ill for three days."</p>
<p>Interestingly, the case marker extends its function to abstract concepts like cause, standard of comparison, and circumstances. For example, "You could catch a cold in view of the cold," illustrates its usage in denoting a cause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it serves as a standard of comparison in constructions like "Rude is younger than me." Additionally, it can indicate circumstances, as in "They lived in fear," where the marker highlights the condition or situation.</p>
<p>The versatility of this single case marker is further exemplified in its use with argument-like structures, such as "I overhear him" or "He would entrust the baby to his friend." In these cases, it marks the participant affected by the action.</p>
