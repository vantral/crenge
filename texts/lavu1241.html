<p>Table 1. Adnominal marking of spatial relations in Lavukaleve</p>
<p>In Terrill (2003) spatial expressions of our interest go under the name of &ldquo;spatial adjuncts&rdquo; which is a subclass of nominal adjuncts. In what follows we first recount Terrill&rsquo;s own description of Lavukaleve space encoding. After that we discuss how the actual patterns (found in the examples from the grammar) are different from this description.<br /> NB! We only used 180 relevant examples given in Terrill (2003) and did not peek into Lavukaleve narrative or elicitation corpora (for the sake of time and uniformity of data in this project). Nominal lexicon is divided into <strong>common </strong>and <strong>locational</strong> nouns. Names for most objects belong to the common<strong> noun</strong> class. they can be modified with agreeing adjectives and definite articles. The distinction between locational and common nouns corresponds to the distinction between where- and what-nouns, as formulated, for example, for D&acirc;w by Obert (2019). In Lavukaleve, there is a morphosyntactic difference between where- and what- nouns but it seems that <strong>not all the semantically where- nouns go to the morphosyntactic where-</strong> class, cf. Table 2 below. For example, <em>island</em> and <em>lake</em> take markers of what-nouns (Terrill 2003, p. 163). Thus, it is rather a matter of lexical specification whether a given noun belongs to where- morphosyntactic class. The actual difference between what- and where- marking is formulated as follows:&nbsp;Where-nouns always have a Locative suffix <em>-n</em> when they are used in the expression of space while what-nouns use postpositional flagging.</p>
<p>As for the <strong>internal structure of where-nouns</strong>, some complex morphonological processes are involved in the derivation of where-noun from its citation form (Locative suffix is always just <em>-n </em>but f<strong>ormation of locative stem is highly irregular</strong>).&nbsp; However, if where-nouns are <strong>modified</strong> with agreeing adjectives or definite articles they turn into what-nouns and are used with postpositions rather than with Locative Suffix. Thus, <strong>complex NP always behave as what</strong>- and not where- nouns.</p>
<p>INSERT TABLE 2</p>
<p>Table 2. Semantic categories that belong to the Locational morphosyntactic class</p>
<p>Again, some time-words (e.g. day, year) and some general locations (e.g. island, lake) do not take Locative suffix but take postpositions instead. As for the<strong> place names</strong>, some of them do <strong>not take any marking</strong> at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flags</strong></p>
<p>Apart from <strong>Locative suffix</strong>, Lavukaleve makes use of <strong>postpositions</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;locationals&rdquo;</strong>. Note that <strong>postpositions agree</strong> with nouns they govern. They take prefixes of the object agreement series. Other lexical categories also capable of space encoding such as <strong>&ldquo;locationals&rdquo;</strong> or &ldquo;positional nouns&rdquo; <strong>never bear agreement prefixes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locative suffix <em>-n</em></strong>: suffix of where-nouns functionally akin to the ubiquitous <em>na</em> In all the spatial expressions where-nouns bear this suffix until they are modified with adjectives or definite article</li>
<li><strong>locationals:</strong> This is a morphologically heterogenous class of place-indicating words. It includes words for here/there/far but also <strong><em>uke</em> 'near'; <em>umu</em> 'under, below'; <em>vuli</em> 'behind'; <em>fafaril</em> 'across'; <em>sangine</em> 'together' </strong>(Terrill 2003, p. 62). These are uninflectable elements that &ldquo;function as adjuncts scoping over the whole clause&rdquo;. And it seems like they do not need an overt nominal as postpositions do.</li>
<li><strong>postposition<em> nun</em> FROM</strong>: is also uninflected but it &ldquo;always occurs together with a nominal adjunct immediately following it and together with it forms a complex locational adjunct&rdquo;. Thus, nun is added to the postpositional phrase as a <strong>second postposition</strong> (or to the where-noun modified with LOC suffix). No overt information on what postpositions it can combine with which means no information on its preferred localizations.</li>
<li><strong>postposition <em>namula</em> FROM</strong>: is specified for directionality (Source) thus being functionally akin to <em>nun</em>. What is different here is that it is used instead of other postpositions and not in combination with them. Inflects for person-gender-number.</li>
<li><strong>postposition <em>na</em> LOC</strong>: this one is used to form all sorts of nominal adjuncts. Angela glosses it as &ldquo;in&rdquo; and I call it LOC elsewhere but in fact it is a <strong>general oblique</strong>. It is said to express both Place and Goal. No info on localization preferences. Inflects for person-gender-number.</li>
<li><strong>postposition <em>nam</em> TO</strong>: primarily expresses Goal but may also express place (154). Nothing is said about its preferred localizations. Inflects for person-gender-number.</li>
<li>other postpositions: <strong><em>hal</em> &lsquo;above&rsquo;; <em>tat</em> &lsquo;on top of&rsquo; (ON); <em>hamail</em> &lsquo;facing&rsquo;; <em>fataran</em> &lsquo;straight out from&rsquo;; <em>kelei</em> &lsquo;near&rsquo; (APUD); <em>nal</em> &lsquo;because&rsquo;; <em>ne</em> &lsquo;with&rsquo;; <em>ku</em> &lsquo;like&rsquo;; <em>ham</em> &lsquo;for&rsquo;</strong>. These express topological configurations and nothing is said about their directionality. All these postpositions inflect for person-gender-number. Note that there are no In or Under postpositions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, there is a class of where-nouns that make no Place-Goal distinction since they only take Locative suffix <em>-n</em> which is functionally the same as general oblique postposition <em>na</em>. However, where-nouns may distinguish Source since nothing said on the optionality of<em> nun</em> in source contexts. Seemingly, there is no way to specify topological relations for neither of the directionality values (positional nouns left aside). All of this holds true until where-nouns are modified with adjectives or definite articles. In such cases where-nouns take postpositions just like common nouns.<br /> Common nouns have a strong tendency to use general oblique postposition <em>na</em> to encode all kinds of spatial relations, similar to Locative suffix of where-nouns. But there is a &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; Goal <em>nam</em> and dedicated Source <em>namula</em> (in addition to <em>nun</em>). So common nouns may in principle distinguish between Goal Place and Source. However, these directional postpositions are aligned paradigmatically with other postpositions expressing topological configurations. Which means you can either indicate Goal (<em>nam</em>) or Source (<em>namula</em>) direction or topological configuration (or use general oblique na and leave everything underspecified). From the text it is unclear whether one may use ON or APUD postpositions in the Goal or Source contexts and our default assumption here would be that they are only used in static (Place) situations.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial asymmetries in Lavukeleve</strong><br /> From all the Goal annotated examples there are very few examples of localizations other than GL and Human. <strong>IN+Goal, ON+Goal and APUD+Goal are only attested 1-2 times</strong> and are expressed via general oblique or <em>nam</em> TO. The majority of Goal examples are GL and Human (around 30 in sum) and they make use of general oblique <em>na</em>/<em>nam</em> TO exclusively without any visible patterns. Thus, localization postpositions are indeed absent from the Goal domain but not because relevant configurations are encoded with some alternative means but because there are no such examples.<br /> In the putting and change of posture situations spatial role of the argument cannot be unequivocally established. Here we label it as PLACE/GOAL (P/G). In these domains, the database only contains ON and APUD postpositional expressions. It is possible to express Place+ON by means of the <em>tat</em> ON.TOP postposition or to simply use the general oblique strategy, as the examples below illustrate:</p>
<p>INSERT EXAMPLE 1 (Terrill 2003, p. 326)</p>
<p>INSERT EXAMPLE 2 (Terrill 2003, p. 329)</p>
<p>IN and UNDER situations can be described by means of&nbsp; uninflectable locationals or positional nouns.</p>
<p>Overall, for the P/G and P localizations one may either stick to general oblique marking when describing IN or ON situations or provide a more elaborate expression of IN/ON localization by using postpositions or relational nouns. As Table 3 below shows, the general oblique strategy is more characteristic of IN. APUD and UNDER are always expressed by means of postpositions or relational nouns.</p>
