    <p>Table 1. Adnominal spatial marking in Marind</p>
    <p>The unmarked way to indicate the Goal role of the participant is the verbal Directional prefix <em>k-</em>. An alternative means for the Goal expression is the postposition<em> nanggo(l), </em>cf. (1) below.</p>

    <p>(Olsson 2018, p. 144)</p>
    <p>From the discussion of the locational postpositions (Olsson 2018, p. 98), one can tell that the topologically specific postpositions <em>kala</em> &lsquo;below, under&rsquo;, <em>lahwalah</em> &lsquo;on the top&rsquo;, etc. are in the paradigmatic distribution with the Goal postposition <em>nanggo(l)</em>. From this one may conclude that the adnominal spatial marking does not allow any topological distinctions in the domain of Goal.</p>
    <p>For the change of posture and &lsquo;putting&rsquo; events, the Goal status of the Ground does not receive any overt marking. Instead, it gets topologically specified with the locational postpositions <em>kala</em> &lsquo;below, under&rsquo;, <em>lahwalah</em> &lsquo;on the top&rsquo;, etc, cf. (2) below.</p>

    <p>(Olsson 2018, p. 295)</p>
    <p>The latter also applies to the role of Place proper where no movement is involved. Locational postpositions are used alongside the verbal Inessive and Contessive markers for the topological specification of Place adjunct. Verbal prefixes <em>an-</em> CONT and <em>kwa- </em>IN are the unmarked way to introduce the ON or IN Place adjuncts (Olsson 2018, p. 285, 480). These are also used for the descriptions of the change of posture events.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To indicate the Source role of the participant, the postposition <em>lVk</em> is used which demonstrates infixal agreement with a dependent noun. In the examples, most Source situations involve the GENERAL LOCATION type of Ground. Thus, there is no directly observable evidence of IN, ON or UNDER serving as a Source. However, from the discussion of the locational postpositions (Olsson 2018, p. 98), one can tell that the topologically specific postpositions <em>kala</em> &lsquo;below, under&rsquo;, <em>lahwalah</em> &lsquo;on the top&rsquo;, etc. are in the paradigmatic distribution with the Source marking. From this one may conclude that the adnominal spatial marking does not allow any topological distinctions in the domain of Source.</p>
    <p>In short, Goal and Source adnominal marking in Marind is structurally similar as neither allows to indicate the topological configuration. As for the Place marking, the distinctions between being inside something, on the top of something, etc. are expressed by the means of the locational postpositions. Grounds in the change of posture events clearly pattern together with Place rather than with Goal.&nbsp;</p>
