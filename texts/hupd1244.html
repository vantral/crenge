<p>Table 1. Adnominal spatial marking in Hup</p>
<p>In Hup, the spatial role of the argument may either be encoded via adpositional / case marking, or may not be overtly expressed by any flagging. In the latter case, the role of an argument is evident from the lexical semantics of the verb (Epps 2008, p. 463). Here, we are only concerned with the adnominal marking, leaving the verbal semantics aside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All means of adnominal space marking may be classified into postpositions and case markers. There are two case markers <em>-Vt</em> and <em>-an, </em>both attested on the nominal Grounds and on the locative postpositions themselves. Epps (2008) uses the label Directional Object-like Oblique for <em>-an </em>(p. 181) and General Oblique for <em>-Vt </em>(p. 184). Trivially, the latter is used to encode various non-core participants and the former only combines with Goal, Place or Source arguments. As Table 1 above demonstrates,<em> -an </em>may be used to express any type of the topological relationships between the Figure and the Goal Ground, save UNDER. Thus, it is the unmarked Goal marker that does not distinguish topological configurations. According to Epps (2008), it is also the unmarked SOURCE marker, c.f. (1) below. At the same time, <em>-an</em> is less often attested with PLACE arguments. However, in the examples, one finds just a few instances of the SOURCE expression with only APUD, HUMAN and GENERAL LOCATION topological classes covered.&nbsp;</p>

<p> (Epps 2008, p.182)</p>
<p>The distribution pattern of <em>-an</em>, though symmetrical as to the (under)differentiation topological configurations in both Source and Goal, is interesting in its own right. Namely, Goal and Source are co-expressed in one marker and are contrasted with Place. This is typologically unexpected and is only reported for one language in the typologically oriented literature (Kutscher 2011).</p>
<p>Place can be expressed by the general oblique <em>-Vt</em> that does not distinguish between being IN, ON, UNDER, etc. This is indeed the most common way to encode Place in the database of examples. Alternatively, one may use spatial postpositions to distinguish between various typological configurations in the Place role, cf. (2) below. In this example, GENERAL LOCATION is encoded by means of the postposition <em>mah</em> &lsquo;near&rsquo; with the directional oblique marker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is unclear for Source whether it is possible to specify all the topological configurations with locative postpositions. However, it clearly emerges from the data that the directional oblique <em>-an </em>is used more often than topologically specific postpositions for both Source and Goal.</p>
